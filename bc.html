                            At SMDevOps we believe that Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) carry the potential to
                            introduce a new level of transparency, automation, and efficiency in businesses and
                            non-profits

                        <p>
                            Most organizations find it challenging to understand and apply the full power of Blockchain
                            Development and DLTs to get tangible business results. Our team is passionate about
                            utilizing our technical capabilities, experience, and product mindset to help our clients
                            effectively extract real business value by implementing blockchain and DLT across their

                                Arguably the most logical use for blockchain Development is as a means to expedite the
                                transfer of funds from one party to another. As noted, with banks removed from the
                                equation, and validation of transactions ongoing 24 hours a day, seven days a week, most
                                transactions processed over a blockchain can be settled within a matter of seconds.

                                Blockchain Development also comes in particularly handy when it comes to monitoring
                                supply chains. By removing paper-based trails, businesses should be able to pinpoint
                                inefficiencies within their supply chains quickly, as well as locate items in real-time.
                                Further, blockchain development would allow businesses, and possibly even consumers, to
                                view how products performed from a quality-control perspective as they travelled from
                                their place of origin to the retailer.

                                Blockchain Development could further revolutionize the retail experience by becoming the
                                go-to for loyalty rewards. By creating a token-based system that rewards consumers, and
                                storing these tokens within a blockchain Development, it would incentivize consumers to
                                return to a certain store or chain to do their shopping. It would also eliminate the
                                fraud and waste commonly associated with paper- and card-based loyalty rewards programs.

                                More than 1 billion people worldwide face identity challenges. Microsoft is looking to
                                change that. It's creating digital identities with face identifier app-- currently used
                                by millions of people -- which would give users a way to control their digital
                                identities. This would allow folks in impoverished regions to get access to financial
                                services, or start their own business, as an example. Of course, Microsoft's attempts to
                                create a decentralized digital ID are still in the early stages.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Copyright and royalty protection</h1>

                            <p>In a world with growing internet access, copyright and ownership laws on music and other
                                content have grown hazy. With blockchain development, those copyright laws would be
                                beefed up considerably for digital content downloads, ensuring the artist or creator of
                                the content being purchased gets their fair share. The blockchain development would also
                                provide real-time and transparent royalty distribution data to musicians and content
                                creators.</p>
                            <h1>Food safety</h1>
                            Yet another intriguing use for blockchain could be in tracing food from its origin to your
                            plate. Since blockchain development data is immutable, you'd be able to trace the transport
                            of food products from their origin to the supermarket. What's more, should there be a
                            food-borne illness, blockchain development would allow the source of the contaminant to be
                            found considerably quicker than it can be now.

                                Blockchain Development might also be the perfect way to back up data. Even though cloud
                                storage systems are designed to be a go-to source for data safekeeping, they're not
                                immune to hackers, or even infrastructure problems. Using blockchain development as a
                                backup source for cloud data centres -- or for any data.

                                The good news is the medical sector has already been moving away from paper for
                                recordkeeping purposes for years. However, blockchain development offers even more
                                safety and convenience. In addition to storing patient records, the patient, who
                                possesses the key to access these digital records, would be in control of who gains
                                access to that data.
